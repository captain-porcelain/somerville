Somerville is a personal maths and visualization project. It is a playgorund for testing artsy stuff
and is most certainly not useful for anybody else.

There is no guarantee for correctness of any implementation, nor for their completeness.

Yet, if you are still are still interested run

```
make fig
```

and play with the visualiaztions in your browser at [http://localhost:9500/](http://localhost:9500/).

It also contains a link to the sidenotes documentation of the project.
